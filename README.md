## **`Overview`**

---

_`The Maze Tower` is a throwback to early 90's freeware made with HTML, CSS & Javascript. The goal of the game is to navigate a seires of mazes using the arrow keys. Avoiding danger and using resources to make your way through to the end._

![](pics/mazzy.png)You play as Mazzy. A kid who got stuck at the bottom of a tower. To get out, Mazzy has to reach the top of the tower by traversing 3 levels of mazes and the escape out the top of the tower.

...Wait... what is Mazzy going to do from the top of a tower? Oh right... along the way you MUST locate the parachute. If Mazzy gets through all 3 levels of the tower without it... well the only taste of freedom Mazzy will have is the few seconds it takes to fall straight to the ground and... **`SPLAT!`**
<br><br>

## **`Gameplay`**

---

The game is played using the arrow keys to move Mazzy around the level to get Mazzy from the bottom of the level to the exit at the top. There are also a few items and elements to be aware of:

**Torches:** Collect a torch so that when levels get dark, Mazzy can see a few tiles around him. To use a torch, press T when it's dark. Torches last for about 4 seconds.

**Ladders:** Sometimes certain important areas are just blocked by a wall. Luckily the tower is filled with ladders. Grab a ladder and place it on a wall to get over the wall and over to the other side. To use a ladder, walk up to a wall, use the arrow key toward the wall you want to get over, then press L. Tada! Now you can move across the wall!

**Planks:** Pick up planks wherever you see them. They will save you from falling into a hole and dying! Once you have a plank, it will place itself as you walk onto a hole. Holes look like the following...

**Hole:** Don't fall in the hole.

**Coins** It's money. Pick it up!
