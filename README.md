# **`The Maze Tower`** - a game by Jon Scarpelli

## **`Overview`**

---

_`The Maze Tower` is an in-browser game where you have to navigate a maze from the bottom of the game space to reach a goal at the top._

You play as Mazzy. A little kid who got stuck at the bottom of a tower. To get out, Mazzy has to reach the top of the tower by traversing 4 levels of mazes and the escape out the top of the tower.

...Wait... what is Mazzy going to do from the top of a tower? Oh right... along the way you MUST locate the parachute. If Mazzy gets through all 5 levels of the tower without it... well the only taste of freedom Mazzy will have is the few seconds it takes to fall straight to the ground and... **`SPLAT!`**

## **`Gameplay`**

---

The game is played using the arrow keys to move Mazzy around the level to get Mazzy from the bottom of the level to the exit at the top. Seems easy enough except that most of the level is dark... you will only be able to see a small area around Mazzy. So be on the look out for routes and try to keep a mental map of where you have been and wherre you can go next.
