making light and dark for each level is a feature that is in flux depending on how new levels emerge.

when you call a new level in the EXIT function, you set whether or not the level starts dark.  0 is light, 1 is dark...

here's the flux part:

right now that's it, 0 or 1.

but the code is close to being able to use 3.  to do this, i would have to go up to the "setbaord" function and add an ELSE IF for the drk parameter.

CURRENTLY i have mocked this up simply by choosing the specific level.  but with more levels, i would have to do it by making the ELSE IF mentioned in the previous line.   This is where I need to take this.


ADDITIONALLY:

i may have to rework this SLIGHTLY so that instead of choosing just 0,1 or 3 (for start light but then go dark).  I want to simply pass through the amount of 
seconds that the level is light.  This would get passed in the EXIT function.  so instead of passing 0,1 etc... i'd pass 3000 for 3 seconds or 5000 for 
5 seconds.  for levels that are meant to be all light i can just pass a huge number. so if the level takes you longer than say 60,000ms, or 60 seconds, it will go dark. which if fair and fun.
